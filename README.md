# functions-Practice

Function 1

Time to test your basic knowledge in functions! Return the odds from a list:

odds([1,2,3,4,5]) #=> [1,3,5]

Function 2

Write a function that always returns 5

Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: 0123456789*+-/

Good luck :)
